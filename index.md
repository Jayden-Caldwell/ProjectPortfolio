## Irobot create 2

The IRobot create 2 is a programmable Roomba robot that is used to inspire generations of innovators. The limitations are endless with the create 2. In this project we are going to try use the create 2 as a base/framework and create a DOT robot that will move around and interact with people though the help of a survey that we will create. I believe this will help inspire new people into the world of Information Technology and gather helpful date that can be used.

### IRobot Code

Below is some simple code I created using the software provided to draw a star.

```markdown
![starCode]{images/Code_for_star)

This code is quite simple but gives an idea of how you could control the robot in a confined space like a small room for example that you knew the size of. Or this could be used to travel to certain places in the room. If there are obstacles that are in the way code could be adapted to avoid the obstacle but still end at the designated point.

![star]{images/Star)

This is the star that was drawn from the above code, as you can see the marker method was created then the robot movement was created.
